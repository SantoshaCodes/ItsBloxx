                                    Tax software works well for simple W-2 returns with standard deductions. However, if you're self-employed, own a business, have investment income, rental properties, or complex deductions, a CPA can identify significant savings that software typically misses. Our clients save an average of $3,200 more per year compared to self-filing.
