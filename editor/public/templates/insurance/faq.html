On average, our clients save approximately $1,200 per year through bundling and other available discounts.

                                        Several factors influence your home insurance rate, including your home's age, construction type, location, replacement cost, and proximity to fire stations. Your claims history, credit score, deductible amount, and the coverage limits you choose also play a role. Installing security systems, smoke detectors, and upgrading your roof can help lower your premium.

                                        Umbrella insurance is recommended for anyone with significant assets to protect, a swimming pool, a teenage driver, pets, or rental properties. It provides an extra layer of liability coverage beyond your home and auto policies, typically starting at $1 million for just $150 to $300 per year. If you are ever sued for damages exceeding your standard policy limits, umbrella insurance covers the difference.

                                        Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (typically 10, 20, or 30 years) and pays a death benefit only if you pass away during that term. It is more affordable and straightforward. Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage and includes a cash value component that grows over time, but comes with higher premiums. Our agents can help you determine which type best fits your financial goals and family situation.

Some changes may result in a premium adjustment. Contact our office and we will process the change and explain any cost differences.
