After all, flowers will wilt and cake will be eaten, but your photos are what you'll hold onto for the rest of your life. Before signing a contract, ask these essential questions: First, what is your shooting style? Every photographer has a distinct approach — documentary, editorial, traditional, or a blend. Look through full galleries, not just highlight reels, to understand what a complete wedding day looks like through their lens. Second, how many weddings have you photographed? Experience matters, especially when it comes to handling unpredictable lighting, tight timelines, and family dynamics. Third, what's included in your packages? Understand exactly what you're getting: hours of coverage, number of edited images, second shooter, engagement session, albums, and print rights. Fourth, what happens if you're unable to shoot on my wedding day? A professional will always have a backup plan and a network of qualified associates. Finally, can I see a full wedding gallery? This reveals consistency, variety, and attention to detail far better than a curated portfolio ever could.",

                "articleBody": "When clients reach out to book a session, one of the first things we discuss is the style they're looking for. Two popular approaches are traditional portrait photography and lifestyle photography, and understanding the difference can help you choose the right fit. Portrait photography is more structured and controlled. It often takes place in a studio or a carefully selected location with intentional lighting, poses, and backdrops. The focus is on creating polished, flattering images where the subject is the clear star. Think professional headshots, senior photos, or classic family portraits. Lifestyle photography, on the other hand, is all about capturing real moments in real environments. Sessions typically happen in your home, a favorite park, or a meaningful location. The photographer guides you through natural interactions rather than stiff poses — playing with your kids, walking hand-in-hand, or laughing together on the couch. The result feels candid, warm, and authentic. Neither style is better than the other; it depends entirely on your personality and what you want from your images. Many of our clients at Frame & Focus actually choose a blend of both approaches for the best of both worlds.",

Here are our top tips from years of working with families of all sizes. Start by coordinating outfits without matching exactly. Choose a color palette of two to three complementary tones and let each family member express their personal style within that range. Avoid large logos, neon colors, and busy patterns that can distract from your faces. Schedule the session during the golden hour — the hour before sunset — for the most flattering, warm light. If you have young children, consider booking during their best time of day when they're well-rested and fed. Bring a few simple props or comfort items for little ones: a favorite toy, a blanket, or a snack for bribes between setups. Let your kids be kids. The best family photos happen when everyone is relaxed and genuine. We'll guide you through poses and interactions, but some of the most treasured images come from unscripted moments — a toddler's giggle, a whispered joke between parents, or siblings chasing each other. Finally, trust your photographer. We've done this hundreds of times and we know how to create beautiful images even when kids are being unpredictable. Relax, have fun, and enjoy the experience.",

                                    Choosing a wedding photographer is one of the most important decisions you'll make during your planning process. After all, flowers will wilt and cake will be eaten, but your photos are what you'll hold onto for the rest of your life. Before signing a contract, ask these essential questions: First, what is your shooting style? Every photographer has a distinct approach — documentary, editorial, traditional, or a blend. Look through full galleries, not just highlight reels, to understand what a complete wedding day looks like through their lens. Second, how many weddings have you photographed? Experience matters, especially when it comes to handling unpredictable lighting, tight timelines, and family dynamics. Third, what's included in your packages?

                                    When clients reach out to book a session, one of the first things we discuss is the style they're looking for. Two popular approaches are traditional portrait photography and lifestyle photography, and understanding the difference can help you choose the right fit. Portrait photography is more structured and controlled. It often takes place in a studio or a carefully selected location with intentional lighting, poses, and backdrops. The focus is on creating polished, flattering images where the subject is the clear star. Lifestyle photography, on the other hand, is all about capturing real moments in real environments.

                                    A little preparation goes a long way toward making your family photo session relaxed, fun, and successful. Here are our top tips from years of working with families of all sizes. Start by coordinating outfits without matching exactly. Choose a color palette of two to three complementary tones and let each family member express their personal style within that range. Avoid large logos, neon colors, and busy patterns that can distract from your faces. Schedule the session during the golden hour — the hour before sunset — for the most flattering, warm light.
